                    <h4>AICTE Guidelines for the prevention and prohibition of ragging in Technical Institutions.</h4>
                    <h6><b>      The Raghavan Committee constituted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court has mentioned the following types of ragging:</b></h6>
                     <ol class="list list-ordened list-ordened-style-3">
										<li> Ragging has several aspects with psychological, social, political, economic, cultural and academic dimensions.</li>
										<li> Any act that prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of a student should be considered to be within the academics related aspects of ragging. Similarly, exploiting the services of a junior student for completing the academic tasks assigned to an individual or a group of seniors is also an aspect of academics related ragging prevalent in many technical institutions.</li>
										<li>Any act of financial extortion or forceful expenditure burden put on the junior students by seniors should be considered as an aspect of ragging for economic dimensions.</li>
										<li>Any act of physical abuse including all variants of it: sexual abuse, homosexual assaults, stripping, forcing obscene and lewd acts, gestured, causing bodily harm or any other danger to health or person can be put in the category of ragging with criminal dimensions.</li>
										<li>Any act or abuse by spoken words, emails, snail-mail, blogs, public insults should be considered to be within the psychological aspects of ragging. This would also include deriving perverted pleasure, the sadistic thrill from actively or passively participating in the discomfiture to others, absence of preparing ‘fresher’s in the run-up to their admission to higher education and life in the hostel and this can be ascribed as a psychological aspect of ragging. Any act that affects the mental health and self-confidence of students also can be described in terms of the psychological aspects of ragging.</li>

				     <h4>Actions against students for indulging and abetting in Ragging in technical institutions, Universities including Deemed to be University imparting technical education.</h4>
