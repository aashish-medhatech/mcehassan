A three-day program on FEEL EMPLOYABLE will be done with the assistance of CLHRD of Mangalore to enhance the soft skills. Two weeks course is conducted after the sixth semester exams by reputed trainers. This includes aptitude training the students on soft skills and aptitude.

                     Apart from placements, regular talks are arranged to educate the students about higher studies in India and across the globe. Importance of GATE is also informed through some expert lectures.</p>
                     <p class="text-justify">TPO has a question bank, where the previous years’ aptitude questions from various companies, puzzles asked during the interviews are included. Students are advised to make use of this question bank and prepare meticulously for the placements.</p>
