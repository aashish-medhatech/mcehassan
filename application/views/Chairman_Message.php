Vision looks upward and becomes faith."</strong> <br />Now, when this vision of duty, aspiration, and faith has become a reality, it is a proud moment for us to see thousands of students pursuing higher education in Malnad College of Engineering (MCE) and equipping themselves to become industry ready professionals for successful careers. In this process, the Management intends to widen all dimensions of Education from Under Graduate to Post Graduate Program in Engineering and Technology. We believe that our Initiative will create an academic foundation for social, cultural, scientific, economic and technological development in our Nation which will mature into Global Interface. Therefore, our focus is to achieve unparalleled excellence that will bring development to our society and mankind by optimizing the potential of students. <br />Dear students, You are the nation-builders. You are the movers of technology. You are the agents of change. It is our fervent hope that the years that you have already spent in MCE has enabled you to equip with leadership and managerial skills.&nbsp; There are challenges to great efforts but, always remember, great effort bears the sweet fruit of success. We want you to taste the fruit of success and focus your efforts to reach the same. There is no single formula for success for all. As Carl Jung says <strong><br />"The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases."</strong><br /> But we should be determined and focused in life. Mark Twain says in his literary works. <br /><strong>"Why do you sit there, looking like an envelope without any address on it?".</strong><br /> What is our address in the envelope of life?&nbsp; We are creators of our own fate. We are creating life every day. As Omar Khayyam writes <br /><strong>"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, <br />Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit <br />Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br /> Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it."</strong><br /> We are creating our future and the moving finger is the divine force which is the guiding light. As John Henry Newman says in his poem The Pillar of Cloud <br /><strong>"LEAD, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom <br />Lead Thou me on! <br />The night is dark, and I am far from home, <br />Lead Thou me on! <br />Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see"</strong><br /> When you travel the path of life, always remember - <br /><strong>"Sea is common for all, some take pearls, some take fishes &amp; some come out with just wet legs. Similarly, the World is common to all but we get what we try for. "</strong><br /> May all you have a blessed life and will become men of values. You will become the change you want to see elsewhere. I wish you all the success.</p>
