I had an opportunity to blend various talents together and make the best utilization of it. We had facilities for physical activities along with a well designed swimming pool.&nbsp; Huge library, wonderful placement wing, spacious auditorium are the highlights of the College.&nbsp; Thank you MCE for making me what I am today.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Malnad College of Engineering is a place where I didn't learn only engineering but learned a lot of life values.&nbsp; MCE has good infrastructure and faculty members.&nbsp; Enough encouragement is given for the overall growth of the students.&nbsp; Sports, cultural activities,&nbsp; technical activities, and all other essential domains are given equal importance here.&nbsp; We had very good training and placement office, where we got opportunities to get in touch with corporate officials.&nbsp; A unique feature of MCE is the existence of many student clubs, which keep the campus lively every weekend even with so many activities. I being the best outgoing student in our batch can confidently say that it's a great place to mold engineering students by nurturing them with skill and knowledge.</p>

Friendly teachers, well-equipped laboratories,&nbsp; decent classrooms,&nbsp; greenish premises,&nbsp; tasty canteen,&nbsp; voluminous library,&nbsp; wonderful placement office and much more. I proudly say to people that I studied in Malnad College of Engineering.&nbsp; I have traveled across a few countries,&nbsp; where I have met a minimum of 4-6 alumni. What I can suggest is apart from the curriculum and co-curricular activities,&nbsp; more technical training needs to be given to the students so that the placement rate is further increased.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">I was an automobile engineering student with an aspiration of getting a job in a good automobile company.&nbsp; But for us the opportunity was less.&nbsp; It's necessary to establish contact with more automobile manufacturing companies and to enhance the technical skills of the students.&nbsp; Though there are qualified and experienced faculty members,&nbsp; they are not able to connect us with more industries.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am not saying they are not putting effort.&nbsp; But it is to be intensified.&nbsp; Inviting people from reputed industries to address the students may help in this regard. Other than this&nbsp; everything is good in the College.&nbsp; What I liked the most was the teak plantation (forest). I have lot of funny memories with me in the College canteen.</p>
