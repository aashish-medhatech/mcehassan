                 <p class="text-justify">The third phase of Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP-III) is fully integrated with the Twelfth Five-year Plan objectives for Technical Education as a key component for improving the quality of Engineering Education in existing institutions with a special consideration for Low Income States and Special Category States (SCS) and support to strengthen few affiliated technical universities to improve their policy, academic and management practices.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">TEQIP III will support approximately 200 engineering education institutes across India to produce higher quality and more employable engineers. The focus of the project is to strengthen engineering education in Indiaâ€™s low-income, hill states and states of the North East. The Project will be implemented as a 'Central Sector Scheme' with total project outlay of Rs. 3,600 crore. However, the project would be initiated with a cost of Rs. 2,660 crore, with the possibility of additional financing of Rs. 940 crore at later stage. Out of the Rs. 2,660 crore, the Central share will be Rs.1,330 crore and external assistance from the World Bank through International Development Association (IDA) Credit of Rs. 1,330 crore. The project is implemented with the facility of Direct Funds Transfer to the accounts of beneficiary institutes. The project started in the current year and will be coterminous with Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) in 2020.</p>
